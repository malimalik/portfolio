            Here is why your past and my past matters.
            Inside of TRW, I have learned a lot. I am mainly in the content creation and AI campus.

          <p className="mb-2 mt-2 p-4">
           I imagine a world where I work as hard as possible every single day so I can have the things that I want.
           Money, cars, being able to provide for my family, every single thing. That's what I am working for. I work every single day such that 
           I can sleep like a donkey and work like a dog.
